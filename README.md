# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Ship-Cutting-Tasks-under-Spatial-Constraints

### Project Overview
Research Project focused on using Reinforcement Learning to train a 7-DoF Franka Panda Emika Robot to perform the ship cutting task while adhering to position and orientation constraints. This work explores progressive complexity in constraint handling, from simple reach tasks to full 7-DoF constrained trajectory following.

### Motivation
The project investigates whether RL-based policies can learn to navigate complex geometric constraints while maintaining tool orientation.

### Robot Platform
- **Robot**: Franka Panda Emika Robot (7-DoF Manipulator)
- **Simulation Environment**: PyBullet with PandaGym
